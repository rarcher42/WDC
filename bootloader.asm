;Intel HEX File Downloader
;Ross Archer, 9 February 2001
;
;This program is freeware. Use it, modify it, ridicule it in public, or whatever, so long as authorship credit (blame?) is given somewhere to me for the base program.
;
;Although this program has worked on two different 65C02-based boards, with TASM output files, I make no warranty of fitness or anything else. It's free -- so no matter what, happens you get your money's worth.;
;
;Feel free to write me at dogbert@mindless.com if you are having difficulties or have suggestions for improvement. This is still a work in progress.
;
;To customize for your 6551-equipped 6502 SBC
;[UK users have dispensation to customise it instead.]
;
;    Set ACIA_BASE to the location of your 6551 ACIA (UART).
;    Change ENTRY_POINT as needed, if you prefer to jump somewhere other than to $0200 after downloading code to RAM.
;    Change .org location to locate START wherever you like. I put it in the top 2K of memory since my hardware write-protects the EEPROM there but allows me to write to the lower 30K at will, making this the only 100% safe place for monitor code in EE. YMMV
;    When burning EPROMs, remember to account for the File offset with your programmer. For example, if burning a 32K E(E)PROM, the offset is $8000. If using a 16K E(E)PROM, the offset is $C000, etc. Best to see that your start vectors are in the top six locations in your E(E)PROM as a sanity check before blasting away.
;    ALL RAM-ified programs you download MUST have an entry point at ENTRY_POINT, if only as a jump instruction to somewhere else.
;    If the user program uses NMI or IRQs, it is responsible for writing the RAM "shadow" vectors at RUN-TIME prior to enabling interrupts. This is because the hex monitor initializes them to a "sane" values pointing into the ROM monitor on every reset, so recovery from user program crashes is always possible.
;    A lot of nice things are missing. For example, no timeouts are provided since that would require support of additional timer hardware. It seems that if a download halts, pressing the big red RESET button is the right thing to do anyways. :) This is minimal bootstrap. It does the job needed and little more. 

; ($7FEB, $7FEA):	NMI RAM vector
; ($7FEF, $7FEE):       IRQ RAM vector
; (User program may not set a new RESET vector, or we could load
; an unrecoverable program into SRAM if battery backed, which would
; kill the system until the RAM was removed!)
;
; 6551 ACIA equates for serial I/O
