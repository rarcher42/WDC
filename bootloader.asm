; FIXME:  Lots of stye mismatch and format ugliness due to merging different code.
;	For now, leave it be so it's obvious what is new and old code.
;	Do a clean-up once there's some confidence in the new parts\\
;
;	Also, re-write code directy from WDCmon in case there are copyright issues.
;	It's all very straightforward code because no sense in importing the nonsense.
