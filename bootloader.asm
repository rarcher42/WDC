;
; 1.	CA2 and CB2 are floating; This ensures writes to system VIA port B don't inadvertently change 
;		the flash bank#.  This is accomplished by writing $00 to SYSTEM_VIA_PCR 
;		Bank # is 0-3, 32K blocks as follows:
;		CB2 supplies A16 to SST39F010A FLASH
;		CA2 supplies A15 to SST39F010A FLASH
;
;    	CB2=0 CA2=0: Bank 0: 	FLASH address: $00.0000 - $00.7FFF	CPU address $00.8000-$00.FFFF - Free
;		CB2=0 CA2=1: Bank 1: 	FLASH address  $00.8000 - $00.FFFF	CPU address $00.8000-$00.FFFF - Free
;		CB2=1 CA2=0: Bank 2: 	FLASH address  $01.0000 - $01.7FFF	CPU address $00.8000-$00.FFFF - Free
;       CB2=1 CA2=1: Bank 3: 	FLASH address  $01.8000 - $01.FFFF  CPU address $00.8000-$00.FFFF - MONITOR 
;
;	It probably goes without saying that trying to change the bank while running from flash requires some trickery.
;   The easiest way to swap banks is to do so from a program running in RAM, but consider that system vectors
;	will change and it may make sense to have a vector and handler in place in each block before a block change.

;
; 2.	System VIA port A is set to all inputs.  Port A is a bi-directional data transfer port to and from the FT245 FIFO
